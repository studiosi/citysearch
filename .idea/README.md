## Requirements

### NVM

This project uses **NVM** (Node Version Manager). In order to run the project locally, the following steps are needed:

First, install NVM. Installation instructions can be found in the [project's website](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating).

Once installed, you can run the following command at the root of the project

```
nvm use
```

This sets the node version to the one used by the project, as specified in the file `.nvmrc` if it is installed locally. Otherwise, it prompts to install it, which can be done with the command

```
nvm install <VERSION>
```

The required version can be found in said file.
